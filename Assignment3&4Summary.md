# Assignment 3 & 4 Summary

In Assignments 3 and 4, I worked through the process of critiquing, redesigning, and testing a data visualization using the "critique by design" approach. Here's a summary of my thoughts, and key takeaways.

## Why This Visualization Was Included

I chose to redesign a data visualization from MakeoverMonday which illustrates the trend of how LLMs grow overtime. I have techinical background and really into LLMs, thats why I chose this topic. And I find there are some overlaping features which is annoying, I want to have a more detailed view of this visualizaiton and that's why I chose to redesign it.

## Overall Process

1. **Critique and Analysis**: I read through Steven's visualization evaluation metrics, and evaluate this original visualization accordingly.  

2. **Wireframe and Feedback**: Next, I sketched a wireframe for my redesigned version, and I chose to bring it to my friend and my mom. 
Becuase these people are perfect representation of audience. Some audience have technical background while some audience do not.
I compare their feedback and try to revise my visualization to fullfill both their requirement. Which is "Filter". This is one ofthe most powerful tool. By applying filter, my friend can focus on detail while my mom want to see big picture.

3. **Redesign in Tableau**: Taking the feedback into account. I added several lines human expert score, average score, acceptable score. Hopefully this can help my audience better understand what is MMLU. This is a complex term, and thats why in my final visualization, I added comments about what is MMLU, also, instruction about filter.

## What I Thought
- During this assignment, I realized that creating a data visualization that is clear and engaging for both technical and non-technical audiences is challenging. And in order to make my visualization clear. It is all about removing unnecessary information, in this example, to some extent, the less information is better, because when giving readers so many information, they may not able to grasp the most important information I try to convey.

- My goal was to make the the visualization clear without oversimplifying it. Balancing detail and simplicity was key. Terms like "MMLU" and "parameters" may make sense to data scientists, but they can be confusing to non-technical viewers. So in the portfolio page, I added a terminology explanation for non-technical audience, also I tell them how to use filter. I think it is necessary to think your audience are "dumb", or in other words, treat them like your own child. Place important information in the title, if title is too long, use subtitle.

## What I Learned  

1. **Effective Use of Feedback**: I learned that even small adjustments, like adding a descriptive label or changing a color boundary, can significantly improve clarity and engagement. 

2. **Balancing Clarity and Detail**: The experience taught me the importance of balancing clarity with the amount of information presented. For example, while my friend appreciated a more detailed, zoomed-in view, my relative preferred simplicity. This shows the need for interactive elements (filters) that allow users to customize their view.
