# Wireframes / storyboards
Using the sketches developed last week, I refined the story outline visually. The wireframes include:

- A **map visualization** showing fish distribution in the U.S., categorized by species.
- A **step-by-step infographic** explaining how to start fishing, including obtaining licenses, selecting equipment, and finding fishing spots.
- Draft data visualizations such as:
  - A bar chart showing fishing participation by state.
  - Pie charts highlighting demographic data on fishing.
  - Icon-based visuals for fishing tools and gear.

These wireframes are designed to visually communicate key aspects of the story and guide the user through both the educational and actionable elements.

# Moodboards / personas

### Moodboards
The moodboard includes:
- **Color palette**: Blues and greens representing water and nature.
- **Textures**: Minimalist, clean design with water ripple patterns.
- **Visual elements**: Illustrations of fish, gear, and natural landscapes.

### Personas
1. **Mom (Beginner Angler):** Represents individuals with little knowledge about fishing, needing clear, step-by-step guidance.
2. **Technical Friend:** Represents users with a data-oriented mindset, focusing on clarity, interactivity, and deeper insights into visualizations.

---

# Final Thoughts

The feedback from my mom and technical friend provided complementary insights:
1. **Beginner-friendly adjustments:** Simplify and enhance the educational aspects for non-technical users (e.g., adding photos and steps).
2. **Technical improvements:** Add interactivity and detailed data layers to cater to more advanced audiences.

Next week, I will focus on implementing these changes to ensure the project is accessible, engaging, and informative for both target groups.
