# Wireframes / storyboards
Using the sketches developed last week, I refined the story outline visually. The wireframes include:

- A **map visualization** showing fish distribution in the U.S., categorized by species.
- Detailed visualization about:
  - **The most effective baits** for different fish species.
  - **Fish behavior based on weather conditions**, including how weather impacts bait choice and fish activity.
  - **Geographical fish distribution**, with a focus on seasonal and regional trends.
  - **Best times to catch fish**, highlighting time of day, season.
 
This is the link to my shorthand page: [https://preview.shorthand.com/OBOUmkTFhGY8A7yq](Start your Fishing Journey In the U.S.)

These wireframes are designed to help anglers optimize their fishing experience with data-driven insights.


# User research 

## Target audience
The target audience for this project includes:
1. **Beginner anglers** who want to start fishing but need guidance.
2. **Nature enthusiasts** exploring recreational activities like fishing.
3. **Casual learners** interested in understanding fish distribution and fishing in the U.S.

### Approach to identifying participants:
To ensure diverse feedback, I selected:
- **My relative** A casual learner.
- **My friend** with a technical background who can provide constructive feedback on data visualizations and user interface clarity.
  also he fishes with me a lot.
- **A student (early 20s)** who has recently started fishing as a hobby.

### Interview Script

| Goal                             | Questions to Ask                                                                       |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gauge audience knowledge          | "What do you know about the distribution of fish species across the U.S.?"           |
| Understand bait effectiveness     | "Have you used or heard about specific baits that are effective for certain fish species? Which ones?" |
| Assess understanding of walleye   | "Looking at this map, do you find the information about walleye distribution clear and useful? Why or why not?" |
| Identify project improvements     | "What would you change or add to improve this project, especially regarding the data visualizations or fishing tips?" |

### Interview Findings

#### Participant 1: Still my relative.
1. **Knowledge about fish distribution:**
   - "I don't know much, but I’ve heard that trout and bass are common in lakes. I didn’t realize different fish are found in specific regions."
   
2. **Understanding bait effectiveness:**
   - "I’ve only heard that worms work for most fish, but I don’t know much about other baits. Having a data analysis of baits would be super helpful for beginners like me."

3. **Walleye distribution clarity:**
   - "I didn’t know what a walleye was until now! The map is interesting, but it would be great to have more information about where to find them and what depth they live at."

4. **Suggestions for improvement:**
   - "Add pictures of the fish alongside the map. Beginners like me would find it easier to understand with visuals. Also, it would be good to suggest the best time of day to catch them."

#### Participant 2: Friend in CMU
1. **Knowledge about fish distribution:**
   - "I know salmon are mostly found in the Pacific Northwest and walleye are popular in the Midwest, but I’d love to see this data tied to seasonal migrations or population density."

2. **Understanding bait effectiveness:**
   - "Minnows work well for walleye. It’d be useful if the map highlighted bait recommendations for each fish species."

3. **Walleye distribution clarity:**
   - "The map is clear, but I think it could benefit from showing depth information. Walleye behavior changes with water temperature and time of day, so adding those insights would make it more actionable."

4. **Suggestions for improvement:**
   - "Consider adding interactivity, like filtering the map by season or bait type. A tooltip with more details on fish behavior, such as their preferred water depth or feeding times, would also enhance the user experience."

#### Participant 3:
1. **Knowledge about fish distribution:**  
"I know a little about common fish like bass and catfish, but I wasn’t aware that fish species vary so much by region or season. This information is really new to me."  
2. **Understanding bait effectiveness:**  
"I usually use worms or basic lures because they’re easy to find, but I’d like to know what baits work best for specific fish. That would save me a lot of trial and error."  
3. **Walleye distribution clarity:**  
"The map is helpful, but I’d like to see more details about where and when walleye are most active. Maybe something about how the weather or time of year influences their behavior."  
4. **Suggestions for improvement:**
"I want to know temperature information, also, some in-depth knowledge about "when" to fish.

### Insights from Interviews

The interviews highlight a few key areas to improve:
1. **Beginner accessibility:** Visual aids like pictures of fish and simplified bait recommendations are needed for clarity.
2. **Technical depth:** Advanced users would appreciate more granular data, such as seasonal patterns.
3. **Some advice are useful, some are not** As the content creator myself, I have to filter useful feedback, after all, this presention is not tailored for only one person, I need to make my story more "generic", also some advice have really good insight but technically it is not achieveable.

### Summary
So what I did is adding more visualizations, for example, top bait recommandation, bite time analysis and what's the relation between bitetime and water temperature. Adding some history information which hopefully can attract my audiences attention. 
Also when doing presentation like this, I think it is important to link data to actionable insights, such as pairing specific bait with weather conditions and providing detailed fishing strategies based on geographic and seasonal trends.
