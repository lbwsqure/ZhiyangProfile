# Fishing Hotspots Analysis Project

## Outline

This project aims to analyze where to fish by leveraging data from public APIs and building a custom dataset tailored to my needs. By observing the geographical distribution and migration patterns of various fish species over the past three years, I aim to uncover insights into the movements and hotspots for fishing.

The key objectives of this project include:
- Fetching and processing fish species distribution data using Python APIs.
- Analyzing migration patterns for selected fish species over the last few years.
- Presenting results in a clear and interactive format for storytelling and data visualization.
